  "body" : "<p>I'm trying to set up a situation where I drop files into a folder on one Azure VM, and they're automatically copied to another Azure VM. I was thinking about mapping a drive from the receiver to the sender and using a file watch/copy program to send the files over the mapped drive.</p>\n\n<p>What's a good recommendation for a file watch/copy program that's simple and efficient, and what security setups do I need to get the two Azure boxes to \"talk\" to each other? They're in the same account/resource group/etc, so I'm not going outside of a virtual network or anything like that.</p>\n",
