  "body" : "<p>I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to using macros, but I am running into a problem that I can't explain.</p>\n\n<p>I have used macros to generate the BlockA struct like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define TO_STRUCT(structname, type, member, size) type member size;\n#define MEMBER_COUNT(structname, type, member, size) +1\n#define MEMBER_NAME(structname, type, member, size)  #member,\n\n#define BLOCK_STRUCT_MEMBERS(p)\\\n    p(BlockA, RegTypeA, regA, [5])\\\n    p(BlockA, RegTypeB, regB, )\\\n\n struct BlockA {\n    BLOCK_STRUCT_MEMBERS(TO_STRUCT)\n    int addr;\n    BlockA(int address);\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then, I have printed out the count of how many members were put into the struct using the macros:</p>\n\n<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; BLOCK_STRUCT_MEMBERS(MEMBER_COUNT);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This prints out the correct response: 2, and if I did the same with the second member commented out when I define it in BLOCK_STRUCT_MEMBERS, it prints 1, which makes sense. So that seems to be working. But if I try to print the names of the members using almost exactly the same method, like this, it only prints the name of the first member:</p>\n\n<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; BLOCK_STRUCT_MEMBERS(MEMBER_NAME)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It also complains that it expected an expression when I try to put a semicolon after it, like I did when I printed the count. Why is this happening?</p>\n",
