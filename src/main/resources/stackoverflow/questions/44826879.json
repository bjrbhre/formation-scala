This template will be filled with field-report data, and I want to store each field report in an access database in the same type of template (22 columns + an ID column). How can I use VBA to refer to the rows and columns in access as I would in Excel?</p>\n\n<p>For example, In excel in order to copy rows from one workbook to another, I would do:</p>\n\n<p>Workbook(\"WorkbookName1\").Worksheets(\"Worksheet 1\").Range(\"A4:V4\").End(xlDown).Copy _ Destination:= ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Range(\"A4\").Range(End(xlDown)))</p>\n",
