I need to list some products, get their price, filter(with ajax)... calculate the price and finally add it to the cart.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to connect with PHP, and axios, but with axios I'm not able to connect (could be my knowledge lack about the API's world )</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/</a></p>\n\n<p>I have been using the default library which woocommerce gives, but I cant get some results:</p>\n\n<pre><code>require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';\n\nuse Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Client;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, I have seen some github libraries which seems to be better... like:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kloon/WooCommerce-REST-API-Client-Library\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/kloon/WooCommerce-REST-API-Client-Library</a></p>\n\n<p>I normally use PHP but  if it's better do it with JS or nodeJS, i'll try.</p>\n\n<p>I need some help, Thanks</p>\n",
