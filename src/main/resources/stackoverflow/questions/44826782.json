  "body" : "<p>I have a Datatable table that contains multiple tasks. These tasks each have a database entry with about 30 columns. The table shows just the 5 most important of those columns. When you click on a task, another more detailed view is opened, which lets users edit all 30 fields and save the changes to the database.</p>\n\n<p>The Datatable search function includes just the 5 columns that are shown in the table. I need it to include all 30 columns while still showing only the 5 most important ones. </p>\n\n<p>If it's of any use: I'm using ASP.net MVC5</p>\n\n<p>Any idea where to start or where I can find any useful information?</p>\n",
