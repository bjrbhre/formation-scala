  "body" : "<p>Okay so this might be a very rookie-ish or naive question but I tried searching the internet and have resorted to stack overflow only after not finding anything fruitful. I have been reading about Token based authentication as well as Cookie based authentication. I have come across the opinion that token based authentication is better for Single page web applications but cannot clearly understand why.
