  "body" : "<p>I want to setup an nginx reverse proxy docker container which forwards based on the URL requested. I have setup dns pointing from all these subdomains of domain.com to the nginx server container.</p>\n\n<p>Example scenario:</p>\n\n<p>Request: subdomain1.domain.com\nshould forward to abc.xyz.com:8087</p>\n\n<p>Request: subdomain2.domain.com\nshould forward to abc.xyz.com:8088</p>\n\n<p>I need to know what I should go in the dockerfile and the nginx.conf file to make the above forward happen. Also these forwards will grow in the future, would there be a way to add these programmatically?</p>\n",
