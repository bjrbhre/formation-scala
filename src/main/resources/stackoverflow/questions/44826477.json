  "title" : "Does tf.train.SyncReplicasOptimizer do complete parameter update from aggregated gradients to value for many times?",
  "body" : "<p>In <code>/model/inception/inception/inception_distributed_training.py</code> apply_gradients are called for each worker. </p>\n\n<pre><code>apply_gradients_op = opt.apply_gradients(grads, global_step=global_step) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and go into SyncReplicasOptimizer.py: </p>\n\n<pre><code>  285       # sync_op will be assigned to the same device as the global step.\n  286       with ops.device(global_step.device), ops.name_scope(\"\"):\n  287         update_op = self._opt.apply_gradients(aggregated_grads_and_vars,\n  288                                               global_step)\n  289\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>line 287 are will be executed by each worker process at ps device. </p>\n\n<p>I think, even the the job that aggregating all replicas gradients only works for one time, but once aggregating job finished, all replicas will rpc calls remote apply_gradients operations group to generate next variable value. If that's real, the duplicated apply_gradients can be eliminated by checking is_chief flag. </p>\n\n<p>By the way two more questions: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>How to control the exclusive variable buffer access if multiple updating operations come?  </p></li>\n<li><p>Did we can use \"caching_device\" flag to eliminate multiple remote variable access (multiple network communication procedure) ? if that's ok, how to trigger update(invalid) cached variable if variables on ps are updated?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have carefully read lots of documents and done lots of experiments to verify it, but official answer could be highly appreciated again.  </p>\n",
