  "body" : "<p>I have a Stereo Clip-on Lens that could fit in a mobile phone. It gives me a stereo image of the object that I capture.\nHowever, is it possible to generate a 3D model with the stereo images? \nCan I use the focal length of the camera and use some lasers to extract images exactly at the focal distance of the lens to provide a meaningful depth information?</p>\n",
