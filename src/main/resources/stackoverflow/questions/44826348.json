  "title" : "Exposing powershell Type Definition from module",
  "body" : "<p>I have been testing a new PowerShell module locally, which has several functions and a couple of custom TypeDefinitions that are consumed by other modules.</p>\n\n<p>One type I define is for the Verbosity:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Add-Type -TypeDefinition @\"\npublic enum CommonLogVerbosityLevel\n    {\n        Normal,\n        Detailed\n    }\n\"@\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am able to use the type by using <code>Import-Module</code>, however I want this to autoload (like the functions) once the module is installed. If I don't it errors saying that it cannot find the type.</p>\n\n<p>The test manifest exposes all the functions, but I have defined a stricter manifest for the released version as some functions and types are really only for internal use, so I don't want to expose those when I released the module.</p>\n\n<p>Do I need to add the type to the manifest or find a different way to expose the type? Ideally I would like to know if the manifest can handle this.</p>\n",
