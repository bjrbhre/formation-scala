  "body" : "<p>I want to create some Classes, that have to look a certain way ( the way shown in my example).\nSome of the class properties are classes (or structs) themselves.\nI want to write a method within my classes that get the Property-Values of all the Properties, that are Structs and write them to a string.</p>\n\n<p>So this is what my classes look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class car\n{\n   public string brand;\n   public tire _id;\n   public string GetAttributes()\n   {\n      Type type = this.GetType();\n      PropertyInfo[] properties = type.GetProperties();\n      foreach(PropertyInfo propertyInfo in properties)\n      if (propertyInfo.PropertyType.ToString().Contains(\"_\"))\n      {\n         //I want to write the actual value of the property here!\n         string nested_property_value = ...\n         return nested_property_value;\n      }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this is what my structs look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code> public struct tire\n {\n    public int id;\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this would be the Main Program:</p>\n\n<pre><code>tire mynewtire = new tire()\n{\n   id = 5\n};\n\ncar mynewcar = new car()\n{\n   _id = mynewtire\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Anyone has an idea how to create the GetAttributes-Methode? I've been trying to figure this out for ages now, but don't get there...</p>\n\n<p>I would be really grateful for every kind of help :)</p>\n",
