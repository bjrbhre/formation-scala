  "body" : "<p>I am not sure if I will be able to explain this clearly.</p>\n\n<p>I have a page on the website, lets say <code>www.mywebsite.com/mypage/</code></p>\n\n<p>Due to some business reason I would like to redirect the user to another page in the same website, say <code>www.mywebsite.com/myotherpage/</code> as soon as the user enters <code>www.mywebsite.com/mypage/</code> on the browser and hits go (I mean there is no referred url from which I can maintain any state).</p>\n\n<p><code>Response.Redirect</code> works just fine but due to the round trips it takes one hell of a time to load.</p>\n\n<p>If I use <code>Server.Transfer</code> the loading time reduces significantly (less than half the time taken for <code>Response.Redirect</code>) but the url remains as it is i.e. <code>www.mywebsite.com/mypage/</code>.</p>\n\n<p>My client would like to see the url of the new page in the browser i.e. <code>www.mywebsite.com/myotherpage/</code>.</p>\n\n<p>On googling a little I found <code>window.history.pushState</code> (given <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/824349/modify-the-url-without-reloading-the-page\">here</a>) but this is only applicable to latest browsers.</p>\n\n<p>Also I need this on a mobile device so not sure if this code will work there.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to search on the internet of any better ideas but not able to find one.</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas will be of great help.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n",
