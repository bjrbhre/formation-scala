  "body" : "<p>I have ran into a problem where I read in a CSV file, but I cant seem to be able to plot the analysis to a graph in python. I am reading in the file using pandas but I am unsure as to how I go about the graphs as there are fourteen columns in my data after cleaning. The data types are string and integers. </p>\n\n<p>Is there anyway I can graph this data and what is the best way to go about it. I have made lots of different subsets of the data writing them back into a folder, but its too time consuming. </p>\n\n<p>Any help or advice would be great. This is how I am reading in my CSV and then I was going to create a DataFrame of exactly what I needed and work from there. I was thinking there also maybe an easier way to do this in R ? </p>\n\n<pre><code>import pandas as pd\nfrom pandas import Series, DataFrame\n\nmy_file = pd.read_csv('example.csv')\nmy_file= DataFrame([my_file.w,my_file.x, my_file.y,my_file.z]).T\n</code></pre>\n",
