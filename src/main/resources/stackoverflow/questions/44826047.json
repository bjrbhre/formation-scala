  "body" : "<p>file.txt</p>\n\n<pre><code>www.link.com/1 | linkname1\nwww.link.com/2 | linkname2\nwww.link.com/3 | linkname3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My target is to set the \"<em>www.link.com/1</em>\" link for <strong>start_urls</strong> variable and \"<em>linkname1</em>\" for <strong>name</strong> variable. Then my further codes are able to scrape the data from the link \"www.link.com/1\". then It should process for another line \"<em>www.link.com/2 | linkname2</em>\". I want to carry on the process for thousands of line like these.\nMy code works only for a single line. It is not working for next line. So my question is how can I loop through for all lines in the text file.</p>\n\n<p>My Scrapy Code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>f = open('links.txt', 'r')\nlistoflinks = [line.strip().split(' | ') for line in f.readlines()]\nfor pair in listoflinks:\n    start_url = [pair[0]]\n    name = pair[1]\nf.close()\n\nclass LinkSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"link\"\n    allowed_domains = [\"link.com\"]\n    start_urls = start_url;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I could try this so far. This code only process for one line. I need to do for thousands of line. Any suggestion/hint would be very helpful.</p>\n",
