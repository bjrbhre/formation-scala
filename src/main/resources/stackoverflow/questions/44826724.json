  "body" : "<p>I have next entity's model: the <strong>devices</strong>  are owned by particular <strong>company</strong> to which belongs some <strong>users</strong>.  User with role <em>admin</em> can grant permission for viewing some set of devices to a regular user but only those devices that belong to admin's company. Thus all users except admins can view only subset of all devices in company. \nBased on requirements I decided to make company as <strong>group</strong> and devices as keycloak's <strong>resources</strong>. To evaluating permissions I chose <em>rule based policy</em>.\nThe problem is I ran into next question about hot to implement other relations and business rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Can I set group as an owner of resource to check this relation in policy?</p></li>\n<li><p>Which mechanism better to use in my case grant view permission on particular device to regular user? </p></li>\n</ol>\n",
