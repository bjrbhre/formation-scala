  "body" : "<p>I'm currently trying to add chefspec coverage to our recipes.  I understand ho to write specs against resources to confirm simple things such as software being installed and I know that I can use fauxhai to inspect nodes and so on but I'm really struggling with the code that is inside a ruby block, an object or a library.</p>\n\n<p>I've searched online but not found any examples and so wonder if I've taken the wrong approach.  I'm pretty sure we're bastardising chef to some degree but I'd liek to test as nuch of it as possible so my question really is;</p>\n\n<p>How on earth can you write unit tests against ruby_blocks / converge time components of a recipe?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>\n",
