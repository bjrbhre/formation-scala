  "body" : "<p>I'm trying to make an app that requires two kinds of authentication. A machine login and a user login, I'm using a custom authorizer to authenticate with the two and give access to my AWS resources</p>\n\n<p>What I'm trying to do is the limit the machine login to only be logged in only in one device.</p>\n\n<p>Currently I'm trying to get the list of remembered devices using the <code>cognitoidentityserviceprovider.adminListDevices</code> API of Cognito User pool on <strong>Pre Authentication</strong> trigger of user pool. The problem is that on the event, AWS doesn't specify which device is currently trying to authenticate.</p>\n",
