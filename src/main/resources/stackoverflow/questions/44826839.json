  "body" : "<p>Actually I found the solution of my main problem \"Get the full path to the directory a Python file is contained in\" from the previous answer : <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5137497/find-current-directory-and-files-directory\">Find current directory and file's directory</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And the code below from the answer works well if I run my entire script, in other words, hotkey: F5.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import os \ndir_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, if I just select the two lines of above code and run it, in other words, hotkey F9. Then I will receive the error below:</p>\n\n<p><em>NameError: name '<strong>file</strong>' is not defined</em></p>\n\n<p>So if anyone happens to know why the error occurs, please give a brief explanation. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks a lot!</p>\n\n<p>By the way, i used Spyder(Python 2.7).</p>\n",
