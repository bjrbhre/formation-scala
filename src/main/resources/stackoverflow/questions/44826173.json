I did some digging and it's obvious that .MOV format isn't supported natively by android and the library isn't supporting it either.!? </p>\n\n<p>But come on guys, really.. there has to be a way!? Is there like an api for converting video formats, just giving it URL of the video and it will return it as MP4 !? Anything?</p>\n",
