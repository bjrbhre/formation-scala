  "body" : "<p>I'm implementing a hack in order to scroll the contents of an element using an Angular 1.4 directive. However the code to change the scroll position of the element needs to be done after x seconds of clicking the same element. </p>\n\n<p>This directive does not absolutely nothing but change the scroll position of an HTML element.</p>\n\n<p>Should I be using the native browser <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>$timeout</code> function. I feel that using <code>$timeout</code> is unnecessary as this will trigger the digest cycle (as mentioned this is unnecessary).</p>\n\n<p>So my question really boils down to: Is this a good idea and are there similar or other scenarios where the use of the native <code>setTimeout</code> over <code>$timeout</code> function is warranted.</p>\n",
