  "body" : "<p>So I am creating a GUI and I am trying to make it so that everything fits on the screen appropriately.  I've drawn a rough sketch of what I want each part of the GUI to look like an it's size, so I know the rough dimensions of everything.</p>\n\n<p>The first problem I am having however is setting up the Left half of the screen.</p>\n\n<p>So the Left half consists of a Frame, which we'll call <code>MainFrame</code>, that consists of 2 Frames, which we'll call <code>LabelFrame</code> and <code>ButtonFrame</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>MainFrame</code> needs to be 385 pixels wide, and 460 pixels tall.</li>\n<li><code>LabelFrame</code> should be 375 pixels wide, and 115 pixels tall.</li>\n<li><code>ButtonFrame</code> needs to be 375 pixels wide, and 330 pixels tall.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My issue is I have no idea how to set these sizes to the frames.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried <code>self.config(width = num, height = num)</code> obviously replacing num with the appropriate values, but that didn't do anything.</p>\n\n<p>I know with the window itself there is a <code>.geometry</code> method, but I haven't been able to find an equivalent for tk.Frame</p>\n",
