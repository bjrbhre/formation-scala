  "body" : "<p>so far I have come across two types of languages. Languages where there is a strict format such as </p>\n\n<p>L = {a^n b^n c^n | n >= 1}</p>\n\n<p>This language it's strict for example a's will always come before b's etc.</p>\n\n<p>the other type I've come across is languages where it can be any order.</p>\n\n<p>L = {a,b}* where number of a's > number of b's </p>\n\n<p>this language can be any order of a's and b's its not stuck in place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hvpbS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">For the languages that are structured this machine conveys the general idea</a></p>\n\n<p>but I am having trouble finding the pattern for machines where it can be any order of characters.</p>\n\n<p>For example</p>\n\n<p>L = {a,b,c}* | a's are equal to the minimum of b and c</p>\n\n<p>What is the pattern for those languages? and what are some really helpful techniques to design these?</p>\n",
