  "body" : "<p>Almost have this working. Almost.</p>\n\n<p>My set up is that I have an Azure B2C Tenant set up, and some modified <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-dotnetcore-webapp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">example code</a> that I've changed to reflect the Tenant information. This all works fine locally, with a localhost uri.</p>\n\n<p>My remote set up is a Ubuntu 16.01 server, with a Nginx 1.10.0 webserver acting as a reverse proxy to a .NET Core 1.0.4 and all with a LetsEncrypt SSL cert.</p>\n\n<p>The proxy serves .NET projects fine, however when I hit the sign in it takes me over to the B2C login with an incorrect redirect_url.</p>\n\n<p>I'd expect the value to reflect what is in the settings file, \"https.sub.host.suffix/signin-oidc\" instead I'm getting \"http.sub.host.suffix,sub.host.suffix/signin-oidc\"</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas or suggestions appreciated!</p>\n",
