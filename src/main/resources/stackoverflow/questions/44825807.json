Everything works fine except that I can't get access to internal jar attributes e.g. TextSize, TextColor etc. \nAfter adding zip with res/attr.xml (found that solution on xamarin forums) to binding library and rebuild solution attributes appeared in Resources file and I can access them in properties of Calendar control. The problem is that changing them does nothing at all although there are no building exceptions.\nCan you give me advice what is wrong here?</p>\n\n<p>Link to zip with my project: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BywEimiS61KKTzB6Ti1aT1dnSjQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BywEimiS61KKTzB6Ti1aT1dnSjQ</a></p>\n",
