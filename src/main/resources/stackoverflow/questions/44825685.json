  "title" : "Setting PowerPoint elbow connector adjustment points programmatically",
  "body" : "<p>I am using the ActiveX API for PowerPoint via MATLAB to make/adjust schematics. Elbow connectors are nice in that they automatically follow other shapes as those shapes are moved. However, the automatic routing of the connectors is terrible. There are little yellow diamond-shaped adjustment handles that can be moved with the mouse to put the portions of the line in better places.</p>\n\n<p>As far as my searches have indicated, there is no way to specify the number of adjustment points or add them. However, I would still like to be able to adjust via code the ones that are automatically created when the endpoints are attached to other shapes.</p>\n\n<p>I use the following MATLAB code to interface with PowerPoint (an existing .pptx file):</p>\n\n<pre><code>ppt = actxserver('PowerPoint.Application');\nppt.Visible = 1; %opens ppt on screen (error when hiding window)\nfile = ppt.Presentations.Open([pwd filesep pptFileName]);\nSlide1 = ppt.ActivePresentation.Slides.Item(1);\nanElbowConn = Slide1.Shapes.Item(166); %this is the elbow connector of interest\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can query the position of the adjustment handles just fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt; anElbowConn.Adjustments.Count\nans =\n     2\n&gt;&gt; anElbowConn.Adjustments.Item(1)\nans =\n         -1.20564997196198\n&gt;&gt; anElbowConn.Adjustments.Item(2)\nans =\n          2.97259998321533\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I try to actually set the position for one of the adjustment handles, it  doesn't take it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt; anElbowConn.Adjustments.Item(1) = -1.0\nNo public property Item exists for class Interface.000C0310_0000_0000_C000_000000000046. \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Based on things I have found, it seems like this should be a settable item (i.e. not read-only), but it's not working the way I'm trying it. <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/VBA/PowerPoint-VBA/articles/adjustments-object-powerpoint\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This MSDN page</a> isn't for elbow connectors specifically, but it shows simply assigning a number to the appropriate Item(#). <a href=\"https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/6b4820a2-4acb-4801-b484-5e84465e2416/how-to-change-the-direction-of-elbow-connector-at-glue-of-the-freeform-shape-in-excel-vba?forum=exceldev\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This post</a> suggests that for elbow connectors, the adjustment handles can be set programmatically as well. That post recommended recording a macro and look at the resulting code. You can't record macros in PowerPoint 2010, but Excel can use the same drawing objects so I tried it. The resulting code from the macro recording makes it look like it should indeed be a straightforward assignment:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ActiveSheet.Shapes.Range(Array(\"Elbow Connector 4\")).Select\nSelection.ShapeRange.Adjustments.Item(1) = 2.13462\nSelection.ShapeRange.Adjustments.Item(2) = 1.18726\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>ShapeRange</code> selection is different than what I was trying, but other than that this seems like the same thing. Any suggestions?</p>\n",
