When I switch EnableSsl = true, I get an exception that the server does not support secured connections. </p>\n\n<p>The point is that it works with exactly the same set of settings in our previous project in VS2013. And everything is fine in Outlook. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe some additional settings on IIS are required? </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know what can possibly cause that problem? </p>\n",
