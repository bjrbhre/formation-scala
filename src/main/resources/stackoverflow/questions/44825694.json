  "body" : "<p>I'm trying to fix a bug in some code that was written a long time ago by a colleague of mine. Both of us are stumped because until recently everything worked fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sub paste3()\n\nDim oSh As Shape\n\nn = 4\nDoEvents\nTake2:\nOn Error GoTo Take2:\nSet oSh = ActivePresentation.Slides(n).Shapes.PasteSpecial(ppPasteDefault)(1)\n    ' .PasteSpecial returns a ShapeRange; the (1) at the end of the line above\n    ' returns the first shape in the range. W/o that, you get a type mismatch error\n    ' from trying to assign a range to a shape\n\nWith oSh\n   ' Set position:\n  .Left = 41\n  .Top = 57\n   ' Set size:\n  .Height = 100\n  .Width = 700\n  .TextFrame.TextRange.Font.Size = 11\n\nEnd With\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code fails at the \".TextFrame\" line and gives the error \"Run-time error '-2147024809 (80070057)': The specified value is out of range\".</p>\n\n<p>I can't see why it's doing this. Stepping into the macro you see a cell copied from excel and then pasted into Powerpoint as a textbox (oSh).</p>\n\n<p>I've tried changing the size from 11 to 10, 12 etc. just in case it was some mad error with that but no joy. </p>\n\n<p>Here is what the locals box is saying in the editor:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R6a28.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R6a28.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I don't really understand why this has never thrown an error before as we've been using this macro for over a year with no problems.</p>\n",
