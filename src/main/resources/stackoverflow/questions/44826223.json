  "body" : "<p>I don't know the correct term/word for this question so it may have been answered before. If so please kindly point me to the right direction or edit my question to make more sense.</p>\n\n<p>But basically.</p>\n\n<p>I have a table (call it 'customer') and I want to insert new data (call it 'newcustomers') into customer, which I do using the insert statement. Then the next day another batch of new data arrives and I would like to insert that new batch of data into 'customer' but underneath the previous data ('newcustomers').</p>\n\n<p>My real question is, how do I do this without having to write an insert statement multiple times? I am also aware my IF OBJECT statement deletes the table everytime I execute the statement, reason being I wanted to try create a script that executes with one click of a button</p>\n\n<p>Each day I would like to add new customers underneath the customer table and do this once, e.g. click execute once and the whole script will run/use an automated procedure to run it daily etc.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if I am thinking way outside the box and if there is a simple answer to this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>USE [customerdatabase]\nGO\n\nIF OBJECT_ID('[customerdatabase].[dbo].[CUSTOMER]', 'U') IS NOT NULL\nDROP TABLE [customerdatabase].[dbo].[CUSTOMER];\n\n-- Create your table\nCREATE TABLE [customerdatabase].[dbo].[CUSTOMER]\n\n(\n\n  [Customer lastname] VARCHAR (MAX)\n, [Customer firstname] VARCHAR (MAX)\n\n\n)\n\n-- This will insert data in to the created table from above.\nBULK INSERT CUSTOMER FROM 'C:\\Users\\OriginalDATA.csv'\nWith \n\n(    \n    FirstROW = 2,\n    FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',\n    ROWTERMINATOR = '\\n'\n)\n\n-- Now we want to insert new data for the week.\n\nIF OBJECT_ID('[customerdatabase].[dbo].[newcustomers]', 'U') IS NOT \nNULL\nDROP TABLE [customerdatabase].[dbo].[newcustomers];\n\nCREATE TABLE [customerdatabase].[dbo].[newcustomers]\n\n(\n\n  [Customer lastname] VARCHAR (MAX)\n, [Customer firstname] VARCHAR (MAX)\n\n)\n\n--This inserts new data seperately in to customerdatabase\nBULK INSERT newcustomers FROM 'C:\\Users\\Downloads\\neCustomer.csv'\nWith \n\n(    \n\nFirstROW = 2,\nFIELDTERMINATOR = ',',\n ROWTERMINATOR = '\\n'\n)\n\nINSERT INTO CUSTOMER\nSELECT * FROM newcustomers\n\n-- repeat bulk insert again for next days batch of data\n-- but do I do insert into again?\n</code></pre>\n",
