  "body" : "<p>I have written a library of classes and now I'd like to add functional-style construction much like the XDocument, XElement, XAttribute classes in .NET. Can anyone point me at resources which would describe how to do this. I'm particularly interested in being able to construct objects from a Linq expression.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var graph =\n    new MyClass(\"Root\", from data in list select \n        new MyNodeClass(data.Id)\n    );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm guessing the constructor would look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MyClass(string name, params object[] content) {}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but I'm not sure where to start in terms of processing the Linq statement.</p>\n",
