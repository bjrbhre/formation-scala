  "title" : "How to plot Pandas multilabel data scatterplots in Seaborn using facetgrid?",
  "body" : "<p>I have a dataset which have multiple labels. I want to create a Facetgrid of scatterplots using Pandas and Seaborn. In addition this dataset has different origin which I also want to compare. (For example, this could be the prediction of different ML algorithms and the true labeling in two plots side by side). The plot I want is something like this with room for more methods and labelings:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B5yWh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B5yWh.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Here the right column is the first labeling and the left is the second.</p>\n\n<p>Currently my Pandas dataframe looks like this: l1, l2, method, x, y. Where l1 and l2 are the different labelings. I can plot one column using the following code: </p>\n\n<pre><code>g = sns.FacetGrid(df, row='method', hue='l1')\ng.map(plt.scatter, 'x', 'y')\nsns.plt.show()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But how do I get the second column? The intuitive thing would be to have the hue parameter be a list but that doesn't work.</p>\n",
