  "title" : "Google Analytics - Full URL for Pages",
  "body" : "<p>I need to see full webpage URLs for my analysis (e.g. www.website.co.uk/pages) not just the URIs (e.g. /pages), so I've applied the filter described here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://splitter.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/178552-how-to-show-the-domain-part-of-a-url-in-google-ana\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://splitter.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/178552-how-to-show-the-domain-part-of-a-url-in-google-ana</a> </p>\n\n<p>This works well on the Real-Time Report - it does indeed show the full URLs here. But if I go to \"What pages do your users visit?\", or if I generate a custom report etc, the pages still only show the URI part of the address - which is no good to me.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this? Thanks in advance.</p>\n",
