  "body" : "<p>I have a simple resource dictionary with four main files</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>MainWindow (With some controls)</li>\n<li>Application</li>\n<li>User Control</li>\n<li>Resource Dictionary (With some styles)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I want the styles in the resource dictionary to be accessible across the application so I can use them in MainWindow and my UserControl.</p>\n\n<p>I have placed a resource dictionary with a source in my Application.Resources</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ResourceDictionary Source=\"Assets/ButtonStyle\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However when I am in MainWindow adding the styles to the controls it says it cannot find the styles. It also says it needs a <strong>x:key</strong> on the ResourceDictionary tag in Application.Resources.</p>\n\n<p>I have imported the styles into the Application.Resources and they work fine. However I would like to keep them in the seperate resource dictionary file as I want to distribute it and keep it in order.</p>\n\n<p>Any help is greatly appricated! :)</p>\n",
