  "body" : "<p>I might be doing something wrong, but I have created a Build and a Release in VSTS. For the release I need to execute a task only if one of the previous failed. This is easy for the tasks in the Build, there is a dropdown with several options including \"Only when a previous task has failed\", however for the release, I only have Always run and continue on error, which doesn't work for me. </p>\n\n<p>Is this because the control options for release doesn't support the same options as the build or is somwthing missing for my VSTS?</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate any help you can give me.</p>\n",
