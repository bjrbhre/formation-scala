  "body" : "<p>I am trying to input email and password into PayPal (sandbox mode) using my Robot Framework script. This is a snippet of my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>input text  login_email  ${email}  \ninput text  login_password  ${password} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>login_email</code> is the <em>name</em> of the <em>input</em> field for the email and <code>login_password</code> is for the password. </p>\n\n<p>I am passing the email in the <code>${email}</code> argument and the password in the <code>${password}</code> argument.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't seem to work for some reason. I keep getting this error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>InvalidElementStateException: Message: Element is not currently interactable and may not be manipulated</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The email and password field for PayPal are generated upon the loading of the page. Can that be a reason why they are not accessible? Can anybody help me identify what am I doing wrong here? </p>\n",
