  "title" : "How can I set an SKCameraNode&#39;s position x and y relative to a node?",
  "body" : "<p>I'm setting up my camera node programatically. My goal is to have the camera follow the player node's x axis, but have the y axis of the camera higher than \"player.position.y\", something like \"player.position.y + 300\".</p>\n\n<p>I found this after googling a while about this issue:</p>\n\n<p>cam.position = CGPoint(x: player.position.x, y: player.position.y + 500)</p>\n\n<p>I put this in didMove(to:) along with the setup of the camera:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cam = SKCameraNode() //initialize and assign an instance of SKCameraNode to the cam variable.\n    self.camera = cam //set the scene's camera to reference cam\n    //cam.setScale(1.3)\n\ncam.position = CGPoint(x: player.position.x, y: player.position.y + 500)\n    addChild(cam) //have cam be a child\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've tried putting it before and after the add child(cam) line, but the cam.position line had no effect.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried both setting my camera up as a child of the player node and the scene, but with either method I can get the camera to follow the player but I can't figure out how to manipulate the X and Y separately. The only way Ive been able to affect the cameras position is using \"set scale\" but thats more of a global zoom in/out.</p>\n\n<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n",
