We want other way around . Can we use Angular 2 features within Angular 1.X Application. In future whichever pages is created should be in Angular 2 but need to be worked side by side with Angular 1.X .. Like calling new route or new component from Angular 2 from Angular 1.X. Please let me know whether its possible or not.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks </p>\n",
