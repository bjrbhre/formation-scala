For the above list it should say that there are 3 groups <code>(0..2), (20..32), (89..92)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know there is the k-means algorithm that will split the list in a certain number of groups, but in my case, I need to determine how many groups are in the first place, so k-means doesn;t really help for this.</p>\n\n<p>I will need to do this in PHP if the language has any relevance.</p>\n",
