The URL is not provided by the user, but it is taken from within the extension code. </p>\n\n<p>The HTTP request need to be passed to the address bar because I have an <code>onBeforeRequest</code> observer that I specified it to \"main_frame\" URLs must be able to observe that URL (although not entered by the user). </p>\n\n<p>I looked at webNavigation and webRequest APIs with no hope. Is there any way to achieve that? </p>\n",
