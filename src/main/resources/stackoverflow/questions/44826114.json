It might work once every 50 times or so.</p>\n\n<p>I have jquery injected above this script as well and they are both inside the head tags. Can youtube block <strong>window.onload</strong> event or am I doing something completely wrong?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QlnhA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QlnhA.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n",
