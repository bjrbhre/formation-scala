  "title" : "Python can&#39;t return function value?",
  "body" : "<p>I'm happy to see you. I've recently (2 days ago to be precise) decided to pick python (python 3) as my first programming language. When I started playing around with functions I bumped into a problem I couldn't solve by myself and that's why I decided to ask for advice here.</p>\n\n<p>I've created a simple function that counts from 0 to 100000 that is called when x = 0. The problematic part is that when it finished the function was supposed to return the new x value (which was 100001).</p>\n\n<p>Here's the original code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x = 0\ndef function(x):\n    while True:\n        print(x)\n        x += 1\n        if x == 100001:\n            return x\n            break\nif x == 0:\n    function(x)\nif x==100001:\n    print(\"TRUE\")\nelse:\n    print(\"FALSE\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As I expected after compiling the program started counting at 0 and ended at 100000. Despite that it still printed out \"FALSE\" at the end. I played around with changing numbers and small details, but at the end it still didn't work as intended. Trying to pinpoint the error I reshaped my code into this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x = 0\ndef function(x):\n    while True:\n        print(x)\n        x += 1\n        if x == 100001:\n            print(\"x= %d\" % x)\n            return x\n            break\nif x == 0:\n    function(x)\nif x==100001:\n    print(\"TRUE\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x= %d\" % x)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After counting at the end of output I got the following lines:\nx = 100001\nx = 0</p>\n\n<p>I think that the something is wrong with my function returning \"x\" properly. I tried to find the answer myself, but failed. Any ideas?</p>\n",
