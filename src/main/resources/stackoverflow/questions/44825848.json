  "body" : "<p>I am responsible for hardening IIS servers at my job, and one of the things that we would like to do is to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1, leaving 1.2 as the only active protocol on our servers.  In many cases, this causes no issues, and all we do is set the proper registry keys to disable 1.0 and 1.1, and the applications work fine.  But I have one application that is used to view files from a database that is having a very strange issue.  </p>\n\n<p>This web application has two different file viewers (lets call them A and B), which are just different web pages that pull up images or files.  With TLS 1.2 only, file viewer A works fine, but file viewer B does not.  When I enable TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 on the server, suddenly both A and B work fine.</p>\n\n<p>I am far from an expert in encryption and the use of these protocols, knowing only the basics about how TLS encryption works in theory.  So while I am not looking for a solution to this specific problem, I am hoping that someone could shed some light on how something like this might occur, where an application could require two different encryption protocols within the same system, talking to the same database servers.  </p>\n",
