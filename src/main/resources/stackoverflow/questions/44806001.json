I used for loops and I was wondering if you think there's another way better than this one. Before getting to this I was sorting my array, keeping original indexes, ranking and only afterwards resorting each rank to its original position, what was reeeeeally bad in terms of performance. Now I got to this improved version and was looking for some feedback. Any ideas?</p>\n\n<p>Thank very much in advance. :)</p>\n",
