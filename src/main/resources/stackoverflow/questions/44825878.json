Here's what is there now, which works, but does not sort on any one column, but does allow for sorting the columns, so I need to keep that functionality as well.</p>\n\n<pre><code>IQueryable&lt;Invoice&gt; all3 = this._invoiceRepository.GetAll();\n        var invoices3 = all3.Where(m =&gt; foundInvoiceIdsFromInputFilter.Contains(m.Id));\n        int resultCount = await invoices3.CountAsync();\n        if (input.Sorting.Contains(\"customer\"))\n        {\n            input.Sorting = input.Sorting.Replace(\"customer\", \"customerid\");\n        }\n        List&lt;Invoice&gt; listAsync3 = await invoices3.OrderBy(input.Sorting, new object[0]).PageBy(input).ToListAsync();\n        List&lt;InvoiceListDto&gt; invoiceListDtos = listAsync3.MapTo&lt;List&lt;InvoiceListDto&gt;&gt;();\n        foreach (InvoiceListDto invoiceListDto in invoiceListDtos)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my OrderBy, I tried this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;Invoice&gt; listAsync3 = await invoices3.OrderBy&lt;Invoice&gt;(\"Id DESC\", \ninput.Sorting, new object[0]).PageBy(input).ToListAsync();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It loads sorted by Id, DESC. However the other columns now will not allow for sorting when I try it this way. The sort arrows in jtable are still there, but non-functioning.</p>\n\n<p>How do I simply keep this working as it is now, but have it output the sorting on the Id column descending? Hope this makes sense.</p>\n",
