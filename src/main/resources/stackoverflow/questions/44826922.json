  "body" : "<p>Right now i have a lot of waiting times at work and I'm trying to make the best out of my time. I was looking for some good C++ Tutorials without Indian accent and i came accross Buckys Tutorials. He has a lot of views and a really fun and easy way to explain things. Right now I'm at video the video about polymorphism and virtual functions and his example is extremly helpful and easy to understand. <br>\nI enjoy watching his tutorials but sometimes I wonder if all the content is technically accurate. I know he made some errors when explaining private variables and i also had the feeling he wasn't to certain when explaining Recursion. <br>\nSo what is your opinion of Bucky? Is he a good source of information? Do you know of any other videos with errors?</p>\n",
