For my users' convenience, I would like them to be able to easily select a time interval and include all the values in between (see pictures). Preferably via a Shift+Click+DrawMouse operation, or a Click followed by a Shift+Click.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't seem to be a standard selection mode in DataGridView. Does anyone have a suggestion for solving this?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KBVr7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KBVr7.png\" alt=\"Right way\"></a> \n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAe5N.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OAe5N.png\" alt=\"Wrong way\"></a></p>\n",
