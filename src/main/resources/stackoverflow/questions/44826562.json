  "body" : "<p>I have a little issue with struct in swift. First of all, I'm new in developing apps, but I'm doing my best to learn. \nA few days ago, I've posted my code and someone told me it was better to use struc and work on levels, but to be honest..it's about 4 days that I'm looking on the web how to work with structs..but I can't figure it out how.. </p>\n\n<p>I'm posting here the code...and I hope someone will illuminate me how to adjust the code. </p>\n\n<pre><code>@IBOutlet weak var leftImage: UIImageView!\n@IBOutlet weak var rightImage: UIImageView!\n@IBOutlet weak var sh: UIImageView!\n\nenum correctImageType {\n    case left, right\n}\n\nstruct Level {\n    var word: String\n    var leftImage: UIImage\n    var rightImage: UIImage\n    var soundFile: String\n    var correctImage: correctImageType\n\n    init(word: String, leftImage: UIImage, rightImage: UIImage, soundFile: String, correctImage: correctImageType) {\n        self.word = word\n        self.leftImage = leftImage\n        self.rightImage = rightImage\n        self.soundFile = soundFile\n        self.correctImage = correctImage\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nvar level1 = Level(word: \"dog\", leftImage: UIImage(named: \"foto1.png\")!, rightImage: UIImage(named: \"foto5.png\")!, soundFile: \"s1\", correctImage: .left)\nvar level2 = Level(word: \"horse\", leftImage: UIImage(named: \"foto5.png\")!, rightImage: UIImage(named: \"foto3.png\")!, soundFile: \"s5\", correctImage: .right)\n\n\n@IBAction func nextImage(_ sender: Any) {\n    leftImage.image = level1.leftImage\n    leftImage.isUserInteractionEnabled = true\n    self.view.addSubview(leftImage)\n    let gesture1 = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(ViewController.singleTap1))\n    leftImage.addGestureRecognizer(gesture1)\n\n\n\n}\nfunc singleTap1() {\n    if correctImageType.left == level1.correctImage {\n\n        print(\"ok\")\n    } else {\n\n        print(\"not ok\")\n    }\n}\n\n\nvar player: AVAudioPlayer!\n\n@IBAction func playSound(_ sender: Any) {\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, what I'm trying to do here... When I click on the nextButton I'd like to show 2 images ( left and right ) and a button (playSound). The sound must be linked to one of the two images. My problem is..that I don't know how to make this happen.. I don't know how to work with a struct..</p>\n",
