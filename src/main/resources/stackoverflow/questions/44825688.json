  "body" : "<p>I would like to ask you some hints about the proper way to configure maven in the following scenario:\nI have some artifacts which are currently packaged as jar, but they have maven-bundle-plugin too because I want them become OSGI bundles, nevertheless I didn't change their package to bundle because it exists the case that I want build them as jar (or war sometimes).</p>\n\n<p>To use maven-bundle-plugin with package jar I have followed <a href=\"http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html#adding-osgi-metadata-to-existing-projects-without-changing-the-packaging-type\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this chapter</a> and all worked fine, but now I'm considering to package them with bundle, to gain the full features of maven-bundle-plugin and because my default deploy is to OSGI.</p>\n\n<p>So I would like to know if packaging artifacts as bundles but using them in a not OSGI container may results in troubles, what do you think? Thx</p>\n",
