  "body" : "<p>So I'm using this geocoder module: <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geocoder\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geocoder</a>\nto gather the latitude and longitude of a whole bunch of addresses situated in Ontario, Canada. For whatever reason when I plot the points onto google earth I'm getting pins as far as Florida in the US, which means the geocodes I'm getting are not right.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously this is not what I want, so I was wondering if anyone is familiar with this module and can help me out or knows of one where I would be able to specify the country.</p>\n\n<p>Note: adding CAN or Canada to the end of the address did nothing to change the geocode.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Entering the address 11 SANDY POINT, TORRANCE, ON on google maps will bring up a pin in Ontario (where it's supposed to be) yet the geocode created from this address is situated in Pennsylvania, USA</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>\n",
