  "body" : "<p>We are using redis for caching purpose in our application. </p>\n\n<p>Our aim is to create new connections whenever the existing pool gets exhausted, so that we can keep the number of idle connections minimal.This way a redis-server resource is given to an application-server(s) which really requires it.</p>\n\n<p>Till now we were using  JedisConnectionFactory of spring-data-redis 1.4.2 which uses Jedis 2.6.2 and commons-pool 2.0 version which does not have option of whenExhaustAction like earlier versions.</p>\n\n<p>Please suggest how can we achieve this.</p>\n",
