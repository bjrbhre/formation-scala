  "body" : "<p>I have a mean-stack site with <code>angular-ui-router</code>, now I want to code an Office add-in with a server and a part of its functionality, and interact with Office.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen <code>add-in commands</code>, which permits of going to certain pages from ribbon buttons. But could anyone tell me what should be the best tool to implement navigation (as well as going back &amp; forward) inside the task pane (like <code>ui-view</code> and <code>ui-router</code> for a web site). </p>\n\n<p>For example, how should we implement the <code>navbar</code> and the navigation in the following taskpane?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tyIsHm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tyIsHm.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I have seen some add-ins can launch 2 taskpanes (by 2 ribbon buttons in the same group) at the same time. We can switch between 2 taskpanes, and we can also show them side by side at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know how to achieve this?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HFjKvm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HFjKvm.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n",
