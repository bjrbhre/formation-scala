I dont know how to explain but using Firefox Developer tools I found structure map like that:<br>\nhtml..firefox.firefox54.win32  >> body.navigator.no-footer  >>   div#windowshade.windowshade.search  >>  div.windowshade-body  >>  iframe#windowShadeFrame  >>  html..firefox.firefox54.win32  >>  body.dialog.navigator  >>  form#full_search  >> div#pageContentDiv  >>  div#windowshade-content.windowshade-content form  >>  div#bd  >>  iframe#structure_browser  >>  html..firefox.firefox54.win32  >>  body.structure-browser >>  form  >> div#mx_divBody  >> div#mx_divTree >>  div#mx_divTreeBody >> table#treeBodyTable  >> tbody </p>\n\n<p>In the tbody there are information I am interested in. Is it possible to extract that kind of data? Is it even possible to do with vba?</p>\n",
