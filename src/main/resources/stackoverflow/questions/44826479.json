  "body" : "<p>I'm looking for a way to overlay an image on a rectangle geoJson feature within a leaflet. The image should be rotated and resized to fit inside the feature at all times and regardless of if the user zooms or not. I have already looked at the <a href=\"https://github.com/IvanSanchez/Leaflet.ImageOverlay.Rotated\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leaflet.ImageOverlay.Rotated plugin</a> which doesn't seem to work, it does about the same as the base image ImageOverlay and places the image behind the feature, sticking out of the sides.</p>\n",
