  "body" : "<p>I have pressed the capture button on a VM in dev test labs. Now it looks like I have a generalized VM that looks useless to me. For example, I can not start the VM anymore. It just displays the following error message.</p>\n\n<p>Failed to start virtual machine 'vmname'. Error: Operation 'start' is not allowed on VM 'vmname' since the VM is generalized.</p>\n\n<p>I need to access this VM what can I do ?</p>\n\n<p>** Should I have run sysprep before I hit the capture???</p>\n",
