  "body" : "<p>I have a C# application that uses PcapDotNet to sniff UDP packets with a capture filter.</p>\n\n<p>Works fine, and there is a 6-byte payload but I can't seem to extract it as a byte array.  The UdpDatagram.Payload is a Datagram, with no method to extract the actual payload data. </p>\n\n<p>Datagram has an ExtractPayload() but this gives an ILayer, which I can't seem to use to get to the payload.  </p>\n\n<p>How do you extract the ultimate payload from TcpDatagram or UdpDatagram? </p>\n",
