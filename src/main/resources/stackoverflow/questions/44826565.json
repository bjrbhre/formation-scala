  "body" : "<p>Sorry about the title of this question, I couldn't think of a better way of phrasing it.</p>\n\n<p>I have a column with time ranges in it, i.e.</p>\n\n<p>08:45-17:00</p>\n\n<p>06:00-10:30</p>\n\n<p>09:10-14:30</p>\n\n<p>08:15-16:50</p>\n\n<p>10:15-17:15</p>\n\n<p>15:30-20:10</p>\n\n<p>09:30-13:10</p>\n\n<p>etc.</p>\n\n<p>What I need is a count of those occurrences that cross a comparison time range. For example with a comparison range of 11:00-15:00, the count should include any in the column that:-</p>\n\n<p>(1). has a start time OR end time between 11:00 and 15:00</p>\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n<p>(2). starts BEFORE 11:00 AND ends AFTER 15:00.</p>\n\n<p>In the examples above the count would be 5.</p>\n\n<p>This formula gives the correct result (0 or 1) for individual entries:</p>\n\n<pre><code>=sum(if(or(and(mid(I14,7,5)&gt;\"15:00\",mid(I14,1,5)&lt;\"11:00\"),and(mid(I14,1,5)&gt;\"11:00\",mid(I14,1,5)&lt;\"15:00\"),and(mid(I14,7,5)&gt;\"11:00\",mid(I14,7,5)&lt;\"15:00\")),1,0))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is probably a more elegant way of writing that! </p>\n\n<p>Wrapping an arrayformula around that code doesn't work.</p>\n\n<p>Any help much appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>\n",
