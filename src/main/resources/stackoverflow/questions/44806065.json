  "body" : "<p>I'm making a website and want a navigation bar that stays at the top of the screen. I can do this fine but when I scroll to top it goes above header. How do I get it to stop scrolling with the user before the top of the page? I have watched countless tutorials but none seem to work. I think I need JavaScript to unstick the bar at a certain height, but unsure how. Also how do I restick it when the user scrolls back down?</p>\n",
