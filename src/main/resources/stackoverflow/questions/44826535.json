On speaking, suppose if 'A' needs the call to be connected to 'B' while the caller is on hold and make it as a conference call where the caller, 'A' and 'B' are connected without the call being dropped. I am using Python with Flask framework and please help me on how to achieve this in Twilio?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n",
