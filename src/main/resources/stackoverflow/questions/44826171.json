  "body" : "<p>Given the odds 1/10, meaning 1 in every 10 entrants will win, how can I determine a winner from 200 entrants mathematically? I am trying to determine the correct math algorithm. </p>\n\n<p>I was thinking something along the lines of this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Take the total amount of clients and divide by the odds. Example 200/10 = 20</li>\n<li>Create an array consisting of 10 elements with 20 members each.</li>\n<li>Randomly select one of the groups</li>\n<li>Randomly select someone from the selected group</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This does not look correct. Can someone assist.</p>\n",
