  "body" : "<p>I've started to transfer an old application to a new Rails application. First, i've created it with Rails 5.0, taking the same database i was using in production.  </p>\n\n<p>One of my associations is like:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Conta &lt; ApplicationRecord\n  has_many :conta_cooperados, foreign_key: :id_conta\nend  \n\n\nclass ContaCooperado &lt; ApplicationRecord\n  belongs_to :conta, foreign_key: :id_conta\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If i make a query like:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>Conta.first.conta_cooperados\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I will have the informations i wanted, and it will generate the following SQL:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT `conta_cooperado`.* FROM `conta_cooperado` WHERE `conta_cooperado`.`id_conta` = 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, everything was working very well, but for some reasons i've decided to create a new application with Rails 5.1 and API option enabled.<br>\nAnd now, when i run the same query, the following SQL is generated:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>SELECT  `conta_cooperado`.* FROM `conta_cooperado` WHERE `conta_cooperado`.`conta_cooperado` = NULL  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And this one doesn't bring the expected result, because the <code>'conta_cooperado' . 'conta_cooperado' = NULL</code> part is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know if this happens because i'm using Rails 5.1 instead 5.0, or if because i'm using the api mode, but i am stuck for 2 days in this situation without solution.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I just upgraded my Rails 5.0 application to 5.1 version, and, if until this upgrade everything was working, now i'm having the same problem.<br>\nSo, This situation happens only on 5.1 version of Rails.<br>\nIs there a bug in this version?</p>\n",
