  "title" : "How can I access static object Excel.Application from another class in a C# SharpDevelop add in project?",
  "body" : "<p>I'm currently trying to create an addin for Excel in C# using SharpDevelop and NetOffice. I have my Addin class, and another one designing a form on which I try to interact with the Excel worksheet (i.e. getting/writing cells value...).</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that the object Application in my addin class is static and protected and I can't access it from my other class. I know that with Visual Studio there is a class called Globals which contains all the static members of the project but, in SharpDevelop, there isn't.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone has encountered this issue ? </p>\n\n<p>Thank you, have a nice day.</p>\n",
