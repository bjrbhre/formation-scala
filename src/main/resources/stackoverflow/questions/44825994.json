  "body" : "<p>I'm new to Terraform and have been trying to deploy Windows VMs using the vSphere provider. </p>\n\n<p>I've managed to get the deploy to work, and I can see the customization running and the IP being assigned inside the VM, however Terraform detects an automatically assigned (not dhcp) address 169.x.x.x when the VM first boots (i.e. before the customization runs).</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way for me to get it to wait until after the customization has finished before determining the IP?</p>\n\n<p>I had a similar issue with vagrant, until I used the vsphere.wait_for_sysprep = true directive. Is there something similar for terraform?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance,</p>\n\n<p>Phil</p>\n",
