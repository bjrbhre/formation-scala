  "body" : "<p>Latest Maven version of my project is 2.0.0, however for some reason I worked on some of the folders using older maven version of my project i.e. 1.3.0. What will happen if I check-in these folders in SVN. Will it affect the whole version of my project or only the folders which I am checking-in??</p>\n\n<p>Thanks &amp; Regards!</p>\n",
