  "title" : "Visual Studio Winforms Project Hidden Startup Code",
  "body" : "<p>When creating a VB.NET Winforms Project in Visual Studio, there's a lot of code related to initialization that seems to be hidden. Is there a way to show it in order to see which statements run from the very beginning, through creation of <code>MyProject</code> and <code>MyApplication</code> objects, creation and exhibition of <code>SplashScreen</code> and finally definition and creation of <code>My.Application.ApplicationContext.MainForm</code>? </p>\n\n<p>That is, a Console application project has a <code>Sub Main()</code> that is visible, I presume a Winforms Application should have one too, but it is hidden and packed with the routines that create instances for SplashScreen, main Form and etc. I would like to see and understand better this flow.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n",
