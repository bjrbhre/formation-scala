  "body" : "<p>I understand that when autoread is enabled in Netty's channel configuration then Netty reads from a socket whenever there's data available.</p>\n\n<p>What is not clear to me however is whether Netty will keep on reading data while a message is going through channel's pipeline. </p>\n\n<p>So imagine that a remote party send 100 messages to a socket that's read by Netty. </p>\n\n<p>Since autread is enabled, Netty will read some bytes and fire them off to the pipeline. The first handler will try to make some sense out of the bytes, cut out a frame to pass it on. Let's say that from the bytes that were passed to the handler a frame can be cut out, so it is and it's passed on further down the pipeline. </p>\n\n<p><strong>So the question is</strong>, while the frame is traversing the pipeline on the worker thread, will Netty keep on reading from the socket, or will it wait for the pipeline to finish processing what it has and ONLY then reads from the socket again. </p>\n",
