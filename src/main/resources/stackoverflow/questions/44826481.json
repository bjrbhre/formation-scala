  "body" : "<p>I am attempting to loop through the rows of a database (in this case players) and gather their scores. The columns of the database represent different positions, for each of which a player has a score value. As there are more columns than positions within a formation, the query must SELECT only those 11 columns within the given formation ($most_common_formation). The scores must then be multiplied by the corresponding value in the player's \"total_picks\" column before being placed into a multidimensional array. </p>\n\n<p>The final array should contain the 25 players as arrays, and within each display the \"full_name\" along with the 11 scores that have been multiplied by \"total_picks\".</p>\n\n<p>The $team array holds the \"full_names\" of all players.</p>\n\n<p>Please help it's driving me crazy!</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Create array to hold final scores per player\n$player_scores = array();\n\n// Loop through all players in $team array\nfor ($l=0; $l &lt; 25; $l++) {\n\n    // SELECT each players scores per position in $most_common_formation\n    $players_picks_query = \"SELECT \n                                ?,\n                                total_picks,\n                                ?,\n                                ?,\n                                ?,\n                                ?,\n                                ?,\n                                ?,\n                                ?,\n                                ?,\n                                ?,\n                                ?,\n                                ?\n                            FROM table\";\n\n    // prepare and bind statement\n    $stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $players_picks_query) or die(mysqli_error($conn));\n    mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 'ssssssssssss', $player_name, $pos1, $pos2, $pos3, $pos4, $pos5, $pos6, $pos7, $pos8, $pos9, $pos10, $pos11);\n\n    $player_name = $team[$l];\n    $pos1 = $most_common_formation[0];\n    $pos2 = $most_common_formation[1];\n    $pos3 = $most_common_formation[2];\n    $pos4 = $most_common_formation[3];\n    $pos5 = $most_common_formation[4];\n    $pos6 = $most_common_formation[5];\n    $pos7 = $most_common_formation[6];\n    $pos8 = $most_common_formation[7];\n    $pos9 = $most_common_formation[8];\n    $pos10 = $most_common_formation[9];\n    $pos11 = $most_common_formation[10];\n\n    mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);\n    $result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);\n\n    while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQLI_NUM)) {\n        foreach ($row as $r) {\n            echo \"$r \";\n        }\n        echo \"&lt;br&gt;\";\n    }\n\n    // close statement\n    mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);\n\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n",
