  "body" : "<p>The question is pretty straightforward, I want manage how many calls I send to the server per second do I want the method to be executed only once per second (specifically the block making the REST call). How can I achieve that using a Lock or CountdownLatch or perhaps a much better approach.</p>\n\n<p>I should mention  that I am working in a Spring environment and might be there is a spring configuration I can use.</p>\n\n<p>What I have tried so far? The plain old <code>Thread.sleep</code> in a <code>synchronized</code> method that makes the rest call and I find it quite ugly to look at.</p>\n",
