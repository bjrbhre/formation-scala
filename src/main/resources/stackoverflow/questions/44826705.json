  "body" : "<p>I'm building an app (android + iOS) that needs to be able to reach an API Endpoint through a https proxy.\nThe development environment is Android Studio + Xcode + macOS.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that I'm not able to setup the Android emulator with the https proxy.\n(For iOS app, just setting up the mac network preferences is enought)\nIn Android, I successly set up the http, but not the https.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried setting up the apn at the vitrual device, and running the emulator with <code>-http-proxy</code>. \nAccording to the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">documentation</a> it includes https proxy, but it still not working.\nThe debugger saids that the server response is null when calling https. Http redirects to https.</p>\n\n<p>All of those solutions just works for the http, not for the https.\nI have also tried whit genymotion with no success.</p>\n\n<p>I have tested the API from my computer (via postman) and it is all ok.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone been able to successfully access an https proxy from the Android emulator? It's possible? What settings am I omitting?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much in advance.</p>\n",
