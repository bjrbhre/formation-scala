  "body" : "<p>This is the first time I have uploaded an app to iTunes Connect via Xcode. Is there a time delay for it to show up in the build? I can't see it listed in iTunes Connect Activity tab either.</p>\n\n<p>I have read some people have had issues because the Information Property List didn't have enough information. The app requires permissions for Location, Camera and Photo library usage. They are listed in the plist file but there is no value set for any of them - is that the problem?</p>\n",
