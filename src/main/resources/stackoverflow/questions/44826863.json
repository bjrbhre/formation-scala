The docs state that it is part of the framework </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Face Detection and Recognition</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it is not clear which classes/methods allow us to do so. The closest thing I've found is <code>VNFaceObservation</code> which is lacking significant details.</p>\n\n<p>Is it more of a manual process and we must include our own learned models someway? -- if so, how?</p>\n",
