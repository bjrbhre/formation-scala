(This, I am able to achieve using <code>position absolute</code> and <code>transform translate</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Now, an image needs to be vertically middle aligned, in the <em>remaining space</em>  above the modal and the top of the window.</p>\n\n<p>Is this possible using pure CSS and if so how can be applied? </p>\n",
