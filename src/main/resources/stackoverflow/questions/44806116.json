  "body" : "<p>I'm trying to improve my coding standards by implementing interfaces and abstract classes when necessary, however I would like to ask about practises regarding abstract classes.</p>\n\n<p>I'm creating a web application and one aspect of the site I need to do some data processing, I have created an abstract class and it looks something like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public abstract class TestAbstractClass\n{\n  public abstract void doDataProcessing();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I need to implement this 'doDataProcessing' method a few times throughout the application dependent on where the user is on my site, it will do VERY similar data processing, just with one or two different things.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<p>User is on certain page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public Page1Class: TestAbstractClass\n{\n  public override void doDataProcessing()\n  {\n    //do data processing\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>User is on another page</p>\n\n<pre><code>public Page2Class: TestAbstractClass\n{\n  public override void doDataProcessing()\n  {\n    //do data processing but with slight change\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>User is on another page</p>\n\n<pre><code>public Page3Class: TestAbstractClass\n{\n  public override void doDataProcessing()\n  {\n    //do data processing but with another change\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Would this be best practise? Or is it better just making one class, and just doing various conditional statements on what is being passed into the 'doDataProcessing()' method?</p>\n\n<p>I feel if I do it using the method I have posted, I will be having a lot of duplicate code in these 3 classes, is that OK?</p>\n\n<p>I hope this makes sense.</p>\n",
