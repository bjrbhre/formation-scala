  "title" : "psycopg2 installing 32 bit",
  "body" : "<p>Working in a client environment with a 64 bit machine, a 32 bit python 3.6, and no web access to the outside world (so no pip). </p>\n\n<p>Normally, we install the libraries on our own machine, then copy 'site packages' over. All works just fine, but doesn't for psycopg2. The site admin left me a vm about the error ( and went on vacation). He said he had looked it up and apparently, I need to install the 32 bit version of psycopg2 as it needs to build in it's own environment. All we have is 64 bit.  It's similar to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26314044/i-have-psycopg2-installed-in-virtual-env-but-still-getting-importerror-psycopg2\">installing 32 bit</a> but not quite the same. </p>\n\n<p>No problem deleting psycopg2-64 from my machine, but how do I force pip to install 32 bit version ? I don't see an option. Do I have any other simple choices. </p>\n\n<p>Apologies for not including the original error. I know it makes it hard to troubleshoot</p>\n",
