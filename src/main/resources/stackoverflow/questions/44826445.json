  "body" : "<p>I want to select the entire table from mysql and validate those values using javascript. I know I can do this using AJAX which will send a HTTP request to the server but I feel sending too many HTTP request to the server can be quite bad as the page will load much slower, or I could store the value as the page load in the client cookie. I think it will be much faster but might be too much data stored in the cookie specially if the mysql table is too big.</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think should be the best approach for this? Is it a good thing to store mysql data in a client cookies</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE</p>\n\n<p>Say I have 100 Items in mysql, these 100 items I needed them displayed in a page dynamically, as the next time the page is loaded there might be 101. That means I need to validate how many items are there and allocate them to the page, and im not sure how to do that and where either client side or server side.</p>\n",
