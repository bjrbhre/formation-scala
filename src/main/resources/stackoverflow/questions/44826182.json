  "body" : "<p>I have a class library project and two localizations files:</p>\n\n<p>default: SmsApiLocalization.resx\npolish: SmsApiLocalization.pl.resx</p>\n\n<p>I'am creating dll file from this project and using this file in WinForms application. Problem is, WinForms application is taking values only from SmsApiLocalization.pl.resx (I'am guessing because I have Windows 10 in polish version), no matter what language I'am setting in Program.cs. When I set something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(\"en\");\nThread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(\"en\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Winforms app always takes values from SmsApiLocalization.pl.resx and ignore other localizations. Do Yow how to fix this? I want to create multilanguage Dll file and use this in differents projects.</p>\n",
