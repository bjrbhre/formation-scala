  "title" : "SSRS Hidden Property Causing Issue with Rows that should not be hidden",
  "body" : "<p>My report has 3 groups (Team, AgentID, Agent Name). We have agents that are on more than one team during a period of time. The report returns all sales and cancellations, so we can calcuate a cancel %. When rendering the report, we suppress the sales, and only show detail row data for the cancels. If an agent is on one team and has cancels they would have a cancel% and detail rows, but if on thier second team they had no cancles then thier cancel % would be 0.00 %, and nothing should show for them. </p>\n\n<p>I applied hidden expression on the detail row to hide sales records. That 'appears' to be is working fine.</p>\n\n<p>When I've applied other hidden properties to group rows such as at the  AgentName level group is hides both rows of data for the agents that are on 2 teams.</p>\n\n<p>If an agent has 2 rows of data one on each team, and one is 0.00 % - we need to hide the 0.00 % row but keep the row that has a valid % > 0.00.</p>\n\n<p>This it the expression I'm using for the hidden \n=IIF(Fields!Category.Value = \"Sales\" , True, False)</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated....as I'm fairly new to SSRS and needing to deploy this report.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you,\nCervello</p>\n",
