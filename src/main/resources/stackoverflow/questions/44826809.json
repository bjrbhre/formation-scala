  "body" : "<p>I have two classes in java: Movie and Book (it's a simplified example):</p>\n\n<p>Book can have author:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public class Book {\n\n      public String author;\n\n      public Book(String a) {\n        this.author = a;\n      }\n\n      public String getAuthor(){\n        return author;\n      }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And Movie can have title:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public class Movie {\n\n      public String title;\n\n      public Movie(String t) {\n        this.title = t;\n      }\n\n      public String getAuthor(){\n        return title;\n      }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm trying to put all objects in a list like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    ArrayList myList = new ArrayList();\n\n    Book book = new Book(\"William\");\n    Movie movie = new Movie(\"Titanic\");\n\n\n    myList.add(book);\n    myList.add(movie);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And afterwards I want to count how many books written by John do I have (or any other specific titles). However I can't apply getAuthor() or getTitle() method since java doesn't know what type of object it is</p>\n\n<pre><code>    int counter = 0;\n    for (int i =0;i&lt;myList.size();i++){\n        if (myList.get(i).getAuthor().equals(\"John\") ){\n            counter +=1;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would be able to use if clause, check every time for an object type, and apply different methods for different objects, but this is not viable, since in real-life case I have 20+ classes and it would make code very long and maintainable.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone suggest a solution for this? Thanks in advance!</p>\n",
