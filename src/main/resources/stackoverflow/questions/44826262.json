  "body" : "<p>I used the following code in JQL (Mixpanel) to group my events into groups by <code>user id</code> and <code>offer id</code>, for each group I am only interested in one representative event that was the latest to happen.</p>\n\n<pre><code>.groupByUser(['properties.offer id'], (accumulator, events) =&gt; {\n  if (events.length &gt; 0) {\n    const lastEvent = events[events.length - 1]\n    return lastEvent\n  }\n  return accumulator\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then, arbitrarily, all my events are now grouped like this, each cell is one event:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6aGOj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6aGOj.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I am interested in targeting the users who have a <code>no</code> value for Offer 3, meaning that those with <code>yes</code> for Offer 3 have to be filtered out.</p>\n\n<p>I've been trying to find a way to do this without success. I was thinking if I could group all these events again by users, and filtered out those with a <code>yes</code> for Offer 3, thus I tried <code>.groupByUser()</code> again but Mixpanel won't let me for some reason. Could anyone please suggest any solution to this?</p>\n",
