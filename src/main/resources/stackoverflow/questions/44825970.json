  "body" : "<p>I was working with Selenium WebDriver and it is possible to initialize 1 webdriver at a time. However I want that the webdriver to be initialized during runtime i.e. it sets the driver properties based on the user choice. I know it can be done using nested if-else statement or using switch-case. However I am looking for a better solution for this. Is there some other method for this scenario ?</p>\n",
