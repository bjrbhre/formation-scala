  "body" : "<p>I am using firebase as backend for storage and authentication for the android app. I have created the authentication part. So, far it works well. The problem comes in database part. <br>\nMy question here is:<br><br>\n(i) I want to store list of names and address of client in the firebase database. <code>How can it be done (Considering I have just a text file with 2 columns)?</code> Can this be automated or should it be done manually? i.e. By creating a Location child and in that writing Name with name of client and Value as address. As the list is high is number how can this be automated?<br><br>\n(ii) Once the list is stored on database, I want to distribute specific number of address to specific users only. How can this be done through firebase? Is there any way to distribute say <code>first 10 names and address to user1</code> and <code>next 10 to user2</code> and so on?<br><br>\n(iii) Fetch the address and names from database to the users as list and <code>feed it to Geolocation for validation</code> and <code>obtaining latitute and longitude</code> and <code>further sending it to Maps</code> for navigation.<br><br>\nThat's it. This is the part I am struggling with.<br>\nCan you suggest an aternative to implement this?</p>\n",
